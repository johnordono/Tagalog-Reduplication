Tagalog Reduplication Dictionary<br />
<br />
The goal of this project is to make additions for a Tagalog word dictionary.<br />
The linguistic aspect that I will be looking into is reduplication.<br />
<br />
==== Reduplication in Tagalog Usage ====<br />
<br />
Reduplication in linguistics is a morphological process in which the root or stem
of a word (or part of it) or even the whole word is repeated exactly or with a 
slight change [1]. Reduplication in Tagalog may be of one of more syllables and
it may be at the beginning or end of a word [2]. Types of reduplication are:<br />
	- monosyllabic, where a single syllable is reduplicated<br />
		e.g.<br /> 
	- partial, where one syllable near the beginning of a word is
	  reduplicated, the syllable being either the first syllable of 
	  a root or one of the syllables of a prefix<br />
		e.g. susulat from sulat 'write'<br />
		     magkaka-utang from magka-utang 'owe'<br />
	- full, in which the first two syllables of a word or root are repeated<br />
		e.g. arawaraw from araw 'day'<br />
	- combined partial and full<br />
		e.g. iisaisa from isa 'one'<br />
		     babalibaligtad from baligtad 'turn'<br />
	- reduplication of the final syllable<br />
		e.g. bulaklak from bulak 'flower'<br /> 
<br />		
Reduplication may be either significant or non-significant. Non-significant in the
sense that there is no semantic reason for the reduplication.<br /> 
	e.g. lalaki 'man' or babae 'woman'
However, more often than not, there is a reason why there is reduplication in a word [2].<br />
<br />
The goal os this project will be to find words in Tagalog that match these descriptions
and store them in a list.<br />
