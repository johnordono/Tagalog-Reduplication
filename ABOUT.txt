Tagalog Reduplication Dictionary

The goal of this project is to make additions for a Tagalog word dictionary.
The linguistic aspect that I will be looking into is reduplication.

==== Reduplication in Tagalog Usage ====

Reduplication in linguistics is a morphological process in which the root or stem
of a word (or part of it) or even the whole word is repeated exactly or with a 
slight change [1]. Reduplication in Tagalog may be of one of more syllables and
it may be at the beginning or end of a word [2]. Types of reduplication are:
*	monosyllabic, where a single syllable is reduplicated
+		e.g. olol 'mad'
*	partial, where one syllable near the beginning of a word is
	 reduplicated, the syllable being either the first syllable of 
	 a root or one of the syllables of a prefix
+		e.g. susulat from sulat 'write'
+		     magkaka-utang from magka-utang 'owe'
*	full, in which the first two syllables of a word or root are repeated
+		e.g. arawaraw from araw 'day'
*	combined partial and full
+		e.g. iisaisa from isa 'one'
+		     babalibaligtad from baligtad 'turn'
*	reduplication of the final syllable
+		e.g. bulaklak from bulak 'flower'

Reduplication may be either significant or non-significant. Non-significant in the
sense that there is no semantic reason for the reduplication:
+		e.g. lalaki 'man' or babae 'woman'

However, more often than not, there is a reason why there is reduplication in a word [2].

The goal os this project will be to find words in Tagalog that match these descriptions
and store them in a list.
