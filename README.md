Tagalog Reduplication List<br />
<br />
The goal of this project is to make additions for a Tagalog word dictionary.<br />
The linguistic aspect that I will be looking into is reduplication.<br />
<br />
ABOUT.txt:<br />
- This file includes some background on reduplication in the Tagalog language. In essence, this project's goal is to record words that utilize reduplication by scraping them from Tagalog websites.
<br />
REDUPLICATION-SCRAPER.sh:<br />
- 
+    usage: bash REDUPLICATION-SCRAPER.sh <links.txt> <temp.txt> <output.txt>
- This is the bulk of this project - this is a bash file that takes three .txt files as arguments. The first argument should be a list of websites that you want to pull information from. The second argument is a temp file that holds all of the code pulled from the websites in the first argument. Finally, the third argument is the output file which stores the list of the found words with reduplication.<br />
